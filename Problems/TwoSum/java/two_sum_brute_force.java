// Loop through each element x and find if there is another value that equals to targetâˆ’x.

// Time complexity: O(n2).
// For each element, we try to find its complement by looping through the rest of the array which takes O(n) time.
// Therefore, the time complexity is O(n2).

// Space complexity: O(1).
// The space required does not depend on the size of the input array, so only constant space is used.
